This is the test project for Ciklum.

Task:

Need to build a simple iOS application, which presents data about various countries around the world. As a backend for the application, you'll use an openly available countries REST API - https://restcountries.eu.
You can take the application UI and functionality as far as your imagination (and time) takes you, but please make sure you achieve at least the following:

• The application should consist at least of two views: 
• List of all countries with basic details on each such as: Name (English and local), national flag, population
• Details of a single country, with extended geographical and social introduction
• Make sure the application is adapted to properly run on various screen sizes and devices

TODO:
1. Load SVG images
2. Change app architecture from MVC to MVP
